TITLE: Exercise 4 - Divisors
DESCRIPTION: Create a program that asks the user
for a number and then prints out a list of all the
divisors of that number. (If you donâ€™t know what a
divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into
another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26
because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

    FUNCTION DESCRIPTION:

    GOAL  : This function will check each number
            in that range to see if it divides evenly
            into users entered number.
    INPUT : this function will take in
            one number as a parameter.
    OUTPUT: Print statements to console to inform
            user of every number that evenly divides 
            into the number that the user entered.
