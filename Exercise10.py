TITLE: Exercise 10 : List Overlap Comprehensions
DESCRIPTION: This weekâ€™s exercise is going to be revisiting an 
old exercise (see Exercise 5), except require the solution in 
a different way. Take two lists, say for example these two:

  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
  b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
  
and write a program that returns a list that contains only the 
elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates). 
Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.
